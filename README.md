# Face Detection using face-api - Javascript

We will be setting up real time face detection through a webcam using AI. This AI is so quick that we are able to draw in real time the various faces and expressions of every person in the video without much performance overhead. We will be using the Face API JS library built on Tensor Flow to setup the face detection.

## Concepts Covered:

- Streaming a webcam through HTML.
- Using Face API to detect faces in real time.
- Drawing facial landmarks in real time.
- Determining emotion through facial expressions in real time.
